##
## This file should be copied into /etc/inet/ike/config to enable the
## launch of the IKE daemon, in.iked(1m), at boot time.  You can also
## launch the IKE daemon after creating this file without rebooting by
## invoking /usr/lib/inet/in.iked with a root shell.
##

# Consult the ike.config(4) man page for further details.  Here is a small
# example from the man page.

### BEGINNING OF FILE

### First some global parameters...

## Optional hardware acceleration parameters...
## Use the pathname of a library that supports PKCS#11 in quotes.
## The example path is for the Sun Crypto Accelerator 1000.
# pkcs11_path "/opt/SUNWconn/lib/libpkcs11.so"

## certificate parameters...

# Root certificates.  I SHOULD use a full Distinguished Name.
# I MUST have this certificate in my local filesystem, see ikecert(1m).
cert_root    "C=US, O=Sun Microsystems\\, Inc., CN=Sun CA"

# Explicitly trusted certs that need no signatures, or perhaps self-signed
# ones.  Like root certificates, use full DNs for them for now.
cert_trust    "EMAIL=root@domain.org"

# Where do I send LDAP requests?
ldap_server   "ldap1.domain.org,ldap2.domain.org:389"

# Some PKI-specific tweaks...
# If you wish to ignore CRLs, uncomment this:
#ignore_crls
# If you wish to use HTTP (with name resolution) for URLs inside certs,
# uncomment this:
#use_http
# HTTP proxy and socks URLs should also be indicated if needed...
socks "socks://socks-relay.domain.org"
#proxy "http://http-proxy.domain.org:8080"

## Phase 1 transform defaults...

p1_lifetime_secs 14400
p1_nonce_len 20

## Parameters that may also show up in rules.

p1_xform { auth_method preshared oakley_group 5 auth_alg sha encr_alg 3des }
p2_pfs 2

### Now some rules...

{
   label "simple inheritor"
   local_id_type ip
   local_addr 10.1.1.1
   remote_addr 10.1.1.2
}

{
   # an index-only rule.  If I'm a receiver, and all I 
   # have are index-only rules, what do I do about inbound IKE requests?
   # Answer:  Take them all!

   label "default rule"
   # Use whatever "host" (e.g. IP address) identity is appropriate
   local_id_type ipv4

   local_addr 0.0.0.0/0
   remote_addr 0.0.0.0/0

   p2_pfs 5

   # Now I'm going to have the p1_xforms
   p1_xform
   {auth_method preshared  oakley_group 5  auth_alg md5  encr_alg blowfish }
   p1_xform
   {auth_method preshared  oakley_group 5  auth_alg md5  encr_alg 3des }

   # After said list, another keyword (or a '}') will stop xform parsing.
}

{
   # Let's try something a little more conventional.

   label "host to .80 subnet"
   local_id_type ip
   local_id "10.1.86.51"

   remote_id ""    # Take any, use remote_addr for access control.

   local_addr 10.1.86.51
   remote_addr 10.1.80.0/24

   p1_xform 
   { auth_method rsa_sig  oakley_group 5  auth_alg md5  encr_alg 3des }
   p1_xform
   { auth_method rsa_sig  oakley_group 5  auth_alg md5  encr_alg blowfish }
   p1_xform 
   { auth_method rsa_sig  oakley_group 5  auth_alg sha1  encr_alg 3des }
   p1_xform
   { auth_method rsa_sig  oakley_group 5  auth_alg sha1  encr_alg blowfish }
}

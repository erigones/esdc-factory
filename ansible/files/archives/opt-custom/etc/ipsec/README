This directory permanently stores SmartOS IPSec configuration.

If you want to enable IPSec at boot, edit files in this directory.
The files will be copied to /etc/inet and if necessary,
the appropriate services will be restarted.
If you want to apply new IPSec configuration without reboot, run
/opt/custom/etc/rc-pre-network.d/020-ipsec-restore.sh refresh

Please note that if you use script "esdc-overlay" for altering
overlay/IPSec configuration, it will overwrite these files each run.

# This file should be copied to /etc/inet/ipsecinit.conf to enable IPsec
# systemwide policy (and as a side-effect, load IPsec kernel modules).
# Even if this file has no entries, IPsec will be loaded if
# /etc/inet/ipsecinit.conf exists.
#
# Add entries to protect the traffic using IPSEC. The entries in this
# file are currently configured using ipsecconf from inetinit script
# after /usr is mounted.
#
# For example,
#
#	 {rport 23} ipsec {encr_algs des encr_auth_algs md5}
#
# Or, in the older (but still usable) syntax
#
#        {dport 23} apply {encr_algs des encr_auth_algs md5 sa shared} 
#        {sport 23} permit {encr_algs des encr_auth_algs md5} 
#
# will protect the telnet traffic originating from the host with ESP using 
# DES and MD5.  Also:
#
#	 {raddr 10.5.5.0/24} ipsec {auth_algs any}
#
# Or, in the older (but still usable) syntax
#
#        {daddr 10.5.5.0/24} apply {auth_algs any sa shared} 
#        {saddr 10.5.5.0/24} permit {auth_algs any} 
#
# will protect traffic to/from the 10.5.5.0 subnet with AH using any available
# algorithm.
#
# To do basic filtering, a drop rule may be used. For example:
#
#	 {lport 23 dir in} drop {}
#	 {lport 23 dir out} drop {}
#
# will disallow any remote system from telnetting in.
#
# If you are using IPv6, it may be useful to bypass neighbor discovery
# to allow in.iked to work properly with on-link neighbors. To do that,
# add the following lines:
#
#	 {ulp ipv6-icmp type 133-137 dir both } pass { }
#
# This will allow neighbor discovery to work normally.
#
# WARNING:	This file is read before default routes are established, and
#		before any naming services have been started.  The
#		ipsecconf(1M) command attempts to resolve names, but it will
#		fail unless the machine uses files, or DNS and the DNS server
#		is reachable via routing information before ipsecconf(1m)
#		invocation.  (E.g. the DNS server is on-subnet, or DHCP
#		has loaded up the default router already.)
#
#		It is suggested that for this file, use hostnames only if
#		they are in /etc/hosts, or use numeric IP addresses.
#
#		If DNS gets used, the DNS server is implicitly trusted, which
#		could lead to compromise of this machine if the DNS server
#		has been compromised.

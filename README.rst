Danube Cloud :: Factory
#######################

This repository is used for building various components of Erigones Danube Cloud, as well as the final Danube Cloud USB key image.


Output
======

All build results are stored in following folders in ``build_base_dir``:

* **appliances**: `Danube Cloud appliances <docs/appliances.rst>`_ (VM images), which then become part of the Danube Cloud USB image

    * base-64-es
    * esdc-mon
    * esdc-mgmt
    * esdc-cfgdb
    * esdc-dns
    * esdc-img

* **isos**: ISO images, which are downloaded from external sources and become part of the Danube Cloud USB image.

* **archives**: `Tarballs <docs/archives.rst>`_, which become part of the Danube Cloud USB image (/opt)

    * local
    * monitoring
    * esdc-node

* **platform**: Tarballs, which contain the `hypervisor platform <docs/platform.rst>`_ - SmartOS raw kernel and boot_archive.

* **images**: This is just a directory, which holds symlinks to all appliances in an `IMGAPI <https://images.joyent.com/docs/>`__-like folder structure.

* **usb**: `Danube Cloud USB images <docs/usb-image.rst>`_.


Requirements
============

Two network-connected Linux/Unix machines are required:

* **buildnode** remote host:
    * A SmartOS/ErigonOS machine that is capable of running KVM and OS virtual machines.
    * Required software:
        * Python 2.7

* **builder** local host:
    * The machine (can be a VM), which has this repository checked out.
    * Required software:
        * git
        * Ansible >= 2.0
        * GNU make
        * sshpass
        * OpenSSH client
        * a working ssh-agent with loaded ``build_ssh_key`` (for running git clone on remote host)
        * a running web server (``build_base_url``)

    * Must have a web root directory ready (``build_base_dir``) and the directory structure must be browsable (autoindex in nginx), e.g.:

        .. code-block:: nginx

            server {
                listen       80;
                server_name  _; 
                root /var/www/html;  # build_base_url

                autoindex on;

                location /images {
                    index manifest;
                    default_type application/json;
                }

                location ~ /images/(.*)/(file|.*.zfs.gz)$ {
                    default_type application/octet-stream;
                }
            }

    * **NOTE**: Building the usb-image target currently requires an ErigonOS/SmartOS machine or a zone with ``fs_allowed`` property set to ``"ufs,pcfs,tmpfs"``.


Configuration
=============

Edit ``etc/hosts.cfg`` and ``etc/config.yml``.

* **etc/hosts.cfg**:
    * Adjust the *builder* and *buildnode* IP addresses and python interpreter.

* **etc/config.yml**:
    * ``build_base_url``
    * ``build_base_dir``
    * ``build_ssh_key`` - the *buildnode* must be accessible from the *builder* machine via SSH.
    * ``build_nic_tag``, ``build_gateway``, ``build_netmask`` and ``build_ips`` - modify according to your network settings.
